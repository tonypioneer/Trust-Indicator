## Journey Log
## Conflict Resolution Protocol
- **Purpose:**
<p>The purpose of this document is to outline a well-defined protocol for handling conflicts within our Android development team. This protocol is intended to ensure that disagreements and issues are resolved efficiently and effectively, allowing us to maintain a healthy and collaborative work environment while focusing on the completion of our APP design and testing tasks.</p >

- **Protocol:**
  - **Identifying the Conflict:**
    <p>Team members should openly and respectfully communicate any concerns or disagreements that arise during the course of the project. This may be done in-person, through 
    video calls, or other appropriate communication channels.
    Conflicts should be brought up as soon as possible to prevent escalation and to ensure timely resolution.</p>
  - **Open Discussion:**
    <p>Once a conflict has been identified, all parties involved should engage in an open discussion to better understand the root cause of the issue.</p >
    <p>Each team member involved should have the opportunity to express their perspective and concerns without interruption.
    Have group meeting twice a week on Wednesday(on-campus) and Sunday(on-line).</p >
    <p>Active listening should be practiced by all participants, ensuring that everyone's viewpoint is heard and understood.</p >
  - **Brainstorming Solutions:**
    <p>After all parties have had a chance to express their concerns, the group should brainstorm potential solutions to the conflict.</p >
    <p>Team members are encouraged to offer suggestions and ideas, no matter how unconventional they may seem.</p >
    <p>The team should aim for a consensus-based solution, where all parties involved are in agreement.</p >

## Deliverables
## Future Improvements
Considering future improvements and continuous optimization is crucial when developing a project. While our goal is to deliver a high-quality product at the current stage, we recognize that technology and market conditions are constantly changing. Therefore, we are willing to invest time and effort in thinking and planning for future enhancements.

In the initial phase of project development, our focus is on implementing core features and meeting basic requirements. However, we also understand that this is just the beginning, and we look forward to continuing to improve and refine the product after delivery.

Our team will also maintain an open and flexible attitude. As the project progresses, we are ready to make adjustments and optimizations based on real-world conditions. We deeply understand that project development is an ongoing iterative process, not a one-time task.

In the [future work document](https://anu365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/u7588748_anu_edu_au/EvBFDx0jqfRKpdPKtsqGCjYBnJuhngdVBGx2K9eZBdczjQ?e=Cunmly), we have listed a continuous feature roadmap for accomplishing future objectives. These functionalities represent our team's vision and mission, serving as the guiding direction and goals for our progress.

  
During the implementation of these features, we will also prioritize team cohesion and effective communication. We will actively explore new solutions and ideas, conducting experiments and testing to ensure the stability and reliability of the functionalities. Additionally, we will focus on enhancing the user experience to ensure our product truly meets the needs of our users.
