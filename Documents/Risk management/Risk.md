## 1. Introduction
Risk management plays a very important role in project management. It identifies, evaluates, and controls any known and potential risks in the process of project development.
In this project, we will design a set of risk identification and management methods to help project managers or R&D engineers in risk management.
## 2. Risk management methods
### 2.1 Classification of hazards and risk assessment criteria
In order to identify and manage risks better, firstly, we classify the hazards that risks may bring. We divide the severity of hazards into 5 different levels, from level S1 to level S5. Different levels represent different degrees of severity. Similarly, we divide the probability of hazard occurrence into 6 levels.
#### 1) Classification of the severity of hazards
##### Table 2.1 Classification of the severity of hazards

If the severity of the injury is between two classifications and cannot be accurately estimated, risk analysis should be performed with the more serious classification as much as possible.
#### 2) Classification of the occurrence probability of hazards
##### Table 2.2 Classification of the occurrence probability of hazards

If the occurrence probability of hazards is between two classifications and cannot be accurately estimated, the risk analysis should be performed on the stratification with a higher probability as much as possible.
#### 3) Risk assessment criteria
##### Table 2.3 Risk assessment criteria

In the table above, NAC stands for unacceptable, ACC stands for acceptable and ALARP stands for as low as reasonably practicable.
After taking risk control measures, all residual risks must be controlled to an acceptable level. That is to say, all remaining risks at NAC level are not allowed after measures are taken. On the other hand, the number of risks at ALARP level must be less than 5.
### 2.2 Risk management methods
#### 1) Risk identification
In order to control and manage risks, we should identify the risks and hazards first. We have identified and estimated the risks and hazards for stage one, H1. Below is the initial hazard analysis form we designed (Table 2.4). In this table, we should use system thinking method to analyse and identify all known and potential risks and hazards of the project and the product, including identifying and analysing the hazard type, source, foreseeable sequence of events, and under what circumstances these hazards will occur, what damage or consequences will be caused, and what risk control plans and measures they plan to use.
##### Table 2.4 Initial Hazard Analysis Form

Next, we need to formulate risk control measures and methods for verifying and confirming that the risks have been reduced or eliminated for each identified risk. At the same time, we need to evaluate the severity, probability, and risk level of hazards after risk control, and at the same time, identify whether new risks have been introduced. Table 2.5 is a risk and risk control measures evaluation form we design. We can intuitively know what kind of risk control measures we should conduct, and what effects will the measures achieve.

##### Table 2.5 Risk and risk control measures evaluation form

As shown in Table 2.5, the risk of each hazard has been reduced to an acceptable or reduced level.
The following tables (Tables 2.6 and 2.7) are the risk assessments before and after taking risk control measures, risk and hazards in the stage one is highlighted red. The comparison shows that after the risk control measures are taken, the overall residual risk of the equipment after the design change has been reduced to an acceptable range.
