## 1. Introduction
Risk management plays a very important role in project management. It identifies, evaluates, and controls any known and potential risks in the process of project development.
In this project, we will design a set of risk identification and management methods to help project managers or R&D engineers in risk management.
## 2. Risk management methods
### 2.1 Classification of hazards and risk assessment criteria
In order to identify and manage risks better, firstly, we classify the hazards that risks may bring. We divide the severity of hazards into 5 different levels, from level S1 to level S5. Different levels represent different degrees of severity. Similarly, we divide the probability of hazard occurrence into 6 levels.
