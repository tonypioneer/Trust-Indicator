Credibility symbols have been created for each category of picture that can be distinguished on the website. 
These symbols have been generated following the rules of visual design and provide easy information to the users about the picture classification. As mentioned, the primary categories are trustworthy and untrustworthy images, manipulated pictures which have been modified using software or other means and an ambiguous category to represent unknown source of the image.

These visual cues come together to deliver quick information through the user interface and completes the delivery of research work along with the developed features related to visual cue design and contextual display.
