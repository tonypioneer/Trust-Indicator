# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: Aug 4th,2023 
- Decision Maker: Trust Indicator Backend Development Team (Lingxiu Cai, Yifang Meng, Zhaoyun Zhang)
  
## Background 
As we are initiating the development phase of our project, one of the fundamental decisions we needed to make was selecting an appropriate programming language for our backend development. The decision was pivotal as it would set the stage for the development process, affecting the project's speed, efficiency, and the quality of the final product.

## Decision Options 

- C#: A programming language our team is well-versed in.

- Django, Other languages: Potentially popular choices for backend development but would require our team to learn new skills. 

## Decision Rationale 
**Chosen Option: C#**
#### Rationale:
1. Team Expertise: The team already possesses expertise in C#, which can potentially lead to a smoother and more efficient development process. Starting with a familiar language can prevent delays and overhead associated with learning a new programming language.

2. Code Reusability: If there are existing codebases or libraries that the team has developed using C#, these can potentially be reused, saving time and effort in the development process.

3. Community and Support: C# has a substantial community and extensive documentation, making it easier to find solutions to problems and get support when needed.

4. Integration with Microsoft Products: Given that C# is developed by Microsoft, it can seamlessly integrate with other Microsoft products, which might be beneficial depending on the project's requirements.

5. Performance and Scalability: C# offers robust performance and scalability options, which can be advantageous for creating a reliable and efficient backend.

### Implications:
1. Quicker Project Commencement: Since the team is already familiar with C#, the project can get started without the need for additional training or onboarding.

2. Cost-Efficiency: Using a language the team is already familiar with can prevent additional costs associated with learning new languages or technologies.

3. Future Development: In the future, if the team decides to expand, finding new talent might be easier since C# is a popular programming language with a substantial pool of developers.

## Follow-up Actions 
1. Project Planning: Develop a project plan outlining the phases of backend development using C#.

2. Setup: Set up the necessary structure for C# backend development.

3. Resource Allocation: Allocate resources effectively, considering the team's existing expertise in C#.

4. Feedback and Adjustments: Regularly solicit feedback from the team and make adjustments as necessary to ensure the project progresses smoothly.
