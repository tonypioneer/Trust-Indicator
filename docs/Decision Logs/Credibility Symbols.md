# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: Oct 4th, 2023
- Decision Maker: Vidhu, All members
  
## Background 
With the proliferation of digital media, discerning the authenticity of images has become a significant challenge. We recognised the need for a visual cue system as part of our commitment to enhance image transparency and credibility. This would allow users to quickly identify the trustworthiness and source of images, ensuring a reliable user experience.

## Decision Options 

1. Use text labels for credibility indications.
2. Use a colour-coded system without symbols.
3. Design a symbol set combined with colour-coding for clearer visual indications.

## Decision Rationale 
Option Chosen: Design a symbol set combined with color-coding.

Reasons for Decision:

1. Immediate Recognition: Symbols are universally recognized and can be understood faster than reading text labels.
2. Color Association: The use of specific colours (green, red, orange, and grey) provides an intuitive understanding of the image's credibility status.
3. Universal Appeal: Symbols break language barriers, making the platform user-friendly for a global audience.
4. Simplicity & Clarity: Using straightforward symbols avoids ambiguity and ensures the user gets a clear message about the image's authenticity.
Alternatives Considered:

Using only text labels was deemed less effective due to the additional cognitive load required to read and interpret.

A colour-coded system without symbols might lack clarity and could lead to misinterpretations based on individual colour perceptions.

## Decision Outcome 
We anticipate improved user trust in our platform by adopting a combined approach of symbols and colour-coding for our credibility signals. This decision prioritizes user experience by providing a clear, quick, and effective way to discern the authenticity and source of images.

## Expected Impact

We foresee a positive user reception, with quicker decision-making regarding the trustworthiness of images. The credibility signals should enhance overall user engagement and trust in the platform, leading to increased usage and community contributions.
