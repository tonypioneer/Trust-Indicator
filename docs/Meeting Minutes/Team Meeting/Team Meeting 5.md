# **Team Meeting 5**

## **Date/Time:** 

4 Septmber 2023, 5:00pm – 6:00 pm

## **Location:** 

Online, Microsoft Teams

## **Attendees:** 

Lingxiu Cai, Vidhu Chaudhary, Tony Chen, Song Han, Yifang Meng, Zhaoyun Zhang

## **Agenda:** 

Review audit feedback, discuss team members' tasks during the break. 

**Discussion:**
1. Plan for work over the break:
   - Frontend web disign
   - Backend controllers
   - Research for solutions to show metadata
2. Add a decision log for "why choose ASP/.NET framework" 
3. Team Minutes and Collaboration Evidence:
   - Feedback: There's a limited amount of team minutes, suggesting more notes and artifacts from meetings are expected. Positive contributions from all team members in the git repo are noticeable.
   - Reflection: We understand the concern regarding the limited team minutes. While our git contributions do reflect active collaboration, we'll make a conscious effort to maintain more detailed meeting minutes going forward. 
4. Task-Deliverable Mapping & Time Constraints:
   - Feedback: In the github project the tasks are categorised as Frontend/Backend/Research – it would make more sense if the Priorities were also categorised in this way to get clarity on whether the task actually map to the deliverables. Mapping your deliverable to your tasks would draw a clear line between what you are doing and what you’re going to achieve. There seems to a huge amount of work left but not much time, it’s a real concern.
   - Reflection: We acknowledge the importance of clearly linking our deliverables to our tasks. The concern about time constraints is valid. To address this, we will reassess our project plan, possibly realign some of our priorities, and explore strategies like parallel processing of tasks to ensure we remain on track.
