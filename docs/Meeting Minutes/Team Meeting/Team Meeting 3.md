## **Agenda:** 

Share research findings and assign individual tasks accoridng to the prioritised feature list.

**Discussion:**

1. Discussed the user interface for the application.
2. Discussed the features of available database services and which one would be more suitable.
3. Discussed the structure needed for the database.
4. Give feedback for the presented ideas for trust indicators and access feasibility.
   
## **Decisions:**

1. Firebase is the most suitable database to be used for storing the picture links. Further options were explored but most of them involve subcriptions and special access which is not suitable for the initial stages of our research project.
2. Responsive user interface design is approved by the team members and feedback has been provided.
3. More research needs to be done to finalise trust indicator style to be used for the web-application. Presented ideas were not suitable: using green or red indicator background does not go with the web-application theme, using small symbol set is not user friendly.
