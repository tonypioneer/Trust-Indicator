Trust Indicators is a research project undertaken by the students at ANU College of Engineering, Cybernetics, and Computing under the guidance of Dr. Sabrina Caldwell. It is a part of the TechLauncher project at the Australian National University and the team members are: Lingxiu Cai, Vidhu Chaudhary, Tony Chen, Song Han, Yifang Meng and Zhaoyun Zhang.
  
The project takes inspiration from Dr. Sabrina’s ambition to create a reliable community platform as a source of trustworthy pictures. The objective of the project is to provide trust indicators that identify and differentiate media, primarily images, on the basis of their origins. These origins are initially recognised as sources from creators or artists, artificially generated images and modified or manipulated pictures.
The impact of the project is expected to influence the way media assets are perceived by individual users and organisations. Trustworthy media assets can be utilised to preserve the emotions, values, ideas, and information they carry and pass it on without the fear of losing integrity. 

The scope of the project is limited in terms of authorised users, number of pictures used to build a trustworthy indicator for the model and the exposure of the project. The website facilitates customization for users to describe their presented pictures and metadata information related to a picture is used as a basis to categorise pictures as trustworthy or untrustworthy.

Contribution towards this project officially started in July 2023 and is in continuation.
We request the users to acknowledge the teams’ efforts in delivering the objectives and accomplishing their goals by contributing their work on the website and providing relevant descriptions to associate credibility to their pictures. 

All criticisms and suggestions for the project are welcome and can be put forward to the team representatives: Yifang Meng and Vidhu Chaudhary – yifang.meng@anu.edu.au and vidhu.chaudhary@anu.edu.au.
